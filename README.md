# the-elements-of-reinforcement-learning
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is believe to be a more general approach towards Artificial Intelligence (AI). RL is the foundation for many recent AI applications, e.g., Automated Driving, Automated Trading, Robotics, Gaming, Dynamic Decision, etc. 

With concrete examples, this repository tries introduce clearly the basic elements of RL, e.g., Agent, Environment, State, State Transition, Policy, Action, Reward, Future Return, Discounted Future Return, Exploration &amp; Exploitation, Markov Decision Processing, The Bellman Equation, Policy-based Learning, Value-based Learning, etc.
